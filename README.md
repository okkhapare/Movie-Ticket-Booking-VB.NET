# Movie-Ticket-Booking-VB.NET
My first ever .NET project to enable employees to book a movie ticket!

To run or make any changes....

You will need to change the database directory in the Module, to the MS-Access movie_ticket_booking.accdb file provided. As your directory will be different with respect to where you clone my repository!

Great Going!

Thanks.
